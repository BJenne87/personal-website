            Hi! My name is Benton, and this is where I hope to be showing more of my work in the 
            future. For now, I'm stillearning how to format this in a way that I'd like, so expect 
            more soon! I'll try to have timelines for future changes as deadlines become more 
            concrete, for now, enjoy watching the changes.
        </p>

        <h3>What I'm Working on</h3>
        <p>
            Right now, I'm working on getting this website presentable for
            everyone to see, so expect a lot of changes here in the future.
            After that, check my GitHub to see what I'm up to!
