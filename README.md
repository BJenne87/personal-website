# Personal Website
A copy of all the files used in my personal website, for anyone who is interested. This will be where I store and log my progress updating my website from the first version I made toward the end of college. I've got some background in basic web development, so this will mostly be a way to document my learning of react and some other more advanced concepts.

### Goals
This will be a timeline of some of the goals I had, and an idealized timeline for reference and goal tracking.
- [X] Have a static site in HTML
- [X] convert the static site to basic react by 8/2025
- [X] Add some more content and stylize the page by 8/2025 (keep working)
- [] Stylize the page using an external library like tailwind, maybe add Sass

### Current Learning Goals
- Keep learning react
- Figure out best practices for 
- Learn how to add modern css styling

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
