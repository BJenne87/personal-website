# Personal Website
A copy of all the files used in my personal website, for anyone who is interested. This will be where I store and log my progress updating my website from the first version I made toward the end of college. I've got some background in basic web development, so this will mostly be a way to document my learning of react and some other more advanced concepts.

### Goals
This will be a timeline of some of the goals I had, and an idealized timeline for reference and goal tracking.
- [X] Have a static site in HTML
- [X] convert the static site to basic react by 8/2025
- [X] Add some more content and stylize the page by 8/2025 (keep working)
- [] Stylize the page using an external library like tailwind, maybe add Sass

### Current Learning Goals
- Keep learning react
- Figure out best practices for 
- Learn how to add modern css styling
